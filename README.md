# Automatic_Backup

Automatic Backup and Compression of large file, sped up using Threading.
Multithreading helps in achieving MultiTasking using threads.

Along with Multithreading `gzip` has been used for Compressing large files.
I have made sure that the script required no additional library other than the basic standard packages.

## Setup instructions

As explained there is no specific `requirements.txt`. So no additional library or packages are required.

```
Example Usage - 

python Auto_backup.py -t ./MY_Backup -s ./MY_Dataset -c 100000

```
